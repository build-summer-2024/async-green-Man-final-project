## Dataset
[Shopping Mall Customer Data Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zubairmustafa/shopping-mall-customer-segmentation-data)

## Why did I chose this dataset?

I thought it was a fun dataset to work on, I like business and economics and I'd love to delve into trends and look into the data and try to visualize that data.

## Progress
- [x] Picked dataset
- [x] Defined 10 questions
- [x] Answered 10 questions using Pandas
- [x] Added at least one data visualization (using Matplotlib and/or Seaborn) to each single question
- [x] Prepared presentation slides to present at graduation

## Questions

  - Answer: Gen Z: 51.84, Millenials: 50.22, Gen X: 50.74, Baby Boombers: 5.53, and the Silent Generation: 50.25

- [x] Question 6: Of those in the top 25% of spending, how is it split based on gender and age?
  - Answer: Baby Boomers make the highest percent, followed by Millenials and Gen X, however, it should be noted that this is from 2022 and Gen Z is still relativlely small sample size since this data set only includes those over 18.

- [x] Question 7: How would this visualization look if it was segmented by gender as well?
  - Answer: The distribution is 65% male and 35% female, it should also be noted that there aren't any women who are Boomers or Gen X with high spending score

- [x] Question 8: How is income correlated with Spending Score?
  - Answer: Reaching this point was quite hard, at first I tried a scatter plot, but that was useless, since the dataset is so big, and going with each average for each income ammount was also useless, since there were so many unique incomes. So I split it up into chunks of 5000 dollars (I also tried 1000, 2000, and 300, but the labels ended up not having enough space).
